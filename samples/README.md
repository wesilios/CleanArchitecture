## Sample Projects

The samples folder contains example solutions and projects generated using the Clean Architecture Template. These samples demonstrate best practices for structuring .NET applications with layered architecture, domain-driven design, and separation of concerns.

Each sample showcases:

- Real-world use cases (e.g., color palette management, inventory tracking)
- Clean architecture principles (Domain, Application, Infrastructure, API)
- Preconfigured logging, testing, and documentation 
- Ready-to-run projects for learning, testing, or bootstrapping new solutions

Use these samples as a reference or starting point for your own projects.
