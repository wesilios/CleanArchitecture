# TDD Testing Plans for Clean Architecture Layers

## Domain Layer Testing (✅ Partially Implemented)
Value Objects: Equality, immutability, business rules validation
Entities: Business logic, invariants, domain events
Tools: xUnit, FluentAssertions, Shouldly (already configured)

## Application Layer Testing (Recommended)
Command Handlers: Business logic validation and side effects
Query Handlers: Data retrieval and transformation logic
Tools: Moq for mocking, xUnit for test framework

## Infrastructure Layer Testing (Recommended)
Repository Tests: Data access patterns with in-memory database
Query Service Tests: Complex queries and data mapping
Integration Tests: Database interactions and external services

## Presentation Layer Testing (Recommended)
Controller Tests: HTTP endpoints and request/response mapping
Integration Tests: Full request pipeline testing
Console App Tests: User interface and service integration

# Steps:

## Implement Missing Test Projects:

```bash
# Create test projects for other layers
dotnet new xunit -n CleanArchitecture.Application.UnitTests
dotnet new xunit -n CleanArchitecture.Infrastructure.IntegrationTests
dotnet new xunit -n CleanArchitecture.Presentation.Api.IntegrationTests
```

## Run and Test the Console Application:

```bash
# Start the API first
dotnet run --project src/Presentations/CleanArchitecture.Presentation.Api/

# Then run the console app
dotnet run --project src/Presentations/CleanArchitecture.Presentation.Console/
```

## Add More Test Coverage:
Implement Palette entity tests
Add Application layer handler tests
Create Infrastructure repository integration tests
Build API controller unit tests
The console application is now fully integrated into your Clean Architecture solution and demonstrates proper separation of concerns while consuming your REST API. The TDD testing plans provide a roadmap for comprehensive test coverage across all architectural layers.
